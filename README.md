# Grapher
SuperTango8, Grapher by Algoritmegruppen

Fork from the Grapher project by SuperTango8, Grapher by Algoritmegruppen

From their readme:

This is an Android app for graph drawing and editing, and comes with
several built-in algorithms.  As a graph backend, we are using the
JGraphT library.

The project is released as GPL.

-----

I adapted the project to an Android Studio project and so it would run under Android Marshmallow.
